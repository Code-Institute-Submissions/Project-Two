# Milestone Project Two – Interactive Frontend Development Project.
I have created a fully functional and interactive data dashboard based around the fictitious company ‘Dental Magic’ and its employee’s. The dashboard is extremely simple to use, providing users several dropdown boxes to filter the provided data in order to cater to specific needs. The minimalistic aesthetic design allows anyone to view clean, immediately understandable results to enhance overall usability and experience. 

The dataset used for the project was based around the results from a human resource survey upon the company ‘Dental Magic’. All data is intentionally displayed with a specific heading and a brief description regarding what the chart is showing, which means any user experience is simply effortless. With full use of media queries the results can be fully displayed on any device; large or small. I believe this project has resulted in an efficient, clean looking dataset suitable for any user to experience and enjoy.

## UX

In order to create the most efficient project as possible, one of the first steps was to understand who exactly was going to be using the data dashboard (and why). I came up with 3 main target groups:

#### Past and present employees of the company. 

* Who may want to view the dashboard as an interest in their workplace to gain an overall image of the company and their staff, which may not be as easily achievable in real life. This target group may also be interested in using the dashboard to see which departments are flourishing in terms of staff numbers, hourly wage and more so, an efficient employee could even use the data given to help boost their career within the business. Dropdown boxes allow users to narrow down results and generate highly specific results, so employees can see exactly what they are looking for.

#### Job seekers or agencies with an interest in the company. 

* This target group would be able to take advantage of the data provided within the dashboard to enable a broader view of the company. For example; they could view staff counts within specific departments, or with a simple glance at the current employment status of employee’s, they can clearly see which departments may need an increase of new employee’s in the near future. This is a brilliant tool for both work agencies and job seekers; as it can save a lot of time, especially when considering management of Dental Magic would not need to be contacted in order to discuss statistics of this sort. Job seekers could also use the dashboard to see trends in hourly wages, meaning they could very easily see exactly what career path to go down in order to enhance earning power. This hourly rate data also comes hand in hand with information about each employee’s age, allowing a user to see how experience can affect their wage.

#### Data analyst’s collecting regional or national company data.

* This particular group will find the data dashboard extremely helpful and efficient due to the nature of their work. Let’s say for example; an organisation needed to collect gender statistics for all companies within a specific area. This dashboard provides a perfect solution to a very difficult task. All a user would have to do is simply find the Male to Female comparison bar chart, hover over each gender bar (which is indicated below to ensure the charts are as straightforward as possible), and they are provided with accurate numbers for both genders. Another method they could use would be to simply select the gender dropdown box (again labelled for easy use), and they are presented with all options and the specific number relating to each option. These same methods apply across the board with the project, meaning no matter what task or data anyone would be trying to collect, it is extremely easy and efficient to collect

#### As a general user, I want to be able to clearly understand what is shown to me at first glance so I don’t have to do any further research.

* This was a vital aspect of the project; a main priority of mine was to ensure that any user (regardless of IT experience) could access the dashboard and immediately understand what was being shown to them visually in the form of interactive charts. The primary method I used to ensure this was to create a simple to understand definition of each chart which was used as the title in each specific div. This means at first glance a user is presented with a large, bold title which will naturally be eye catching and the first thing a user will read. This is then followed by a short sentence stating exactly what is shown and how to make the most of the chart if required (usually by instructions based on tooltip statistics). These two methods combined result in a very short but effective description of every chart on the page and are an essential ‘go to’ for understanding fully what is being provided.  

#### As a professional user, I want to be able to gain extra information so I can carry out further research if needed.

* Due to the nature of the specified target groups, it is necessary for me to cater for both laid back users (typically past and present employees), and highly professional users (data analyst’s and agency workers). This means, although the project provides sufficient data to complete research on multiple data segments, it is also wise for me to provide a link to the source file which was used. This means professional users have the opportunity to view a huge file and gain access to more background information to the data set, along with a variety of different data segments to work with. For this reason I have provided a simple introductory div within the project always placed first so it is naturally the first thing a user will read. They are introduced with a brief overview, a link to the main source file and a list of dropdown boxes to enable filtered results. I believe the project does a good job catering for this specific target, making the overall user experience much more positive for everyone.

#### As a user, I want to be able to filter the data given to generate results which are advantageous to me.

* This user story goal is in very strong interest for all listed target groups. For this reason it is the most prominent feature in terms of functionality within the whole dashboard. Many users may find the broad data provided sufficient for their particular task. However, many professional user or more engrossed casual users will want to see narrowed down, specific results. For example, a current employee might want to see a correlation between which departments are lacking in staff numbers but are flourishing in terms of hourly rates of pay. This can be used to gain significant advantage in terms of career progression, especially within ‘Dental Magic’.  All this user would need to do is find the introductory div placed at the beginning of the dashboard, use the multiple dropdown boxes provided efficiently; and they have highly filtered results which can be used at the user’s disposal. 

* A professional user of this dashboard may have been given a goal to examine statistics in terms of each different department within the organisation; this could be age, gender, ethnicity and employment status for example. This could be a highly tedious task which would involve a high number of questionnaires and surveys. However, using the dashboard the user simply would toggle the provided dropdown boxes and they are presented immediately with accurate, filtered data specific to any goal. A huge range of different results can be achieved within the dashboard, with all charts displaying highly accurate results in simple to understand, minimalistic charts.

* Mock-up designs and drawings are provided within directories and can be accessed within the projects Github. You can clearly see the development throughout each stage and can grasp the progress from start to the end product provided. 

## Features

I believe all of the features I have chosen to implement within the project have been considered carefully and have been aligned with efficiency and usability. It is undeniably better to have a handful of genuinely useless features rather than 100 unnecessary ones, so it was highly important for me to get that ratio correct. If all features were not completely effective on my data dashboard (or any project), I would have to consider that a failure as a user would simply not be able to use it to full capacity, or may not use it at all.

## Existing features

1. **Dropdown Boxes**

* Placed within the very top of the dashboard within the introduction div, the user is presented with a selection of dropdown boxes. These boxes can be used to alter the charts to display personalized data specific to the user. The function of these dropdown boxes are defined within the text above and they are all labelled with specific titles to show the user what exactly they can alter. The three boxes can successfully alter the data by filtering in accordance to gender, employee department and race. This results in a very powerful feature which almost all users will take advantage of, regardless of their intentions. This creates a positive user experience which is always great.
 
2. **Tooltip Hover Statistics**

* The information about this feature is again provided within the introduction div of the dashboard, a place every user will be again to scan quickly and see what is available for them to take advantage of. This feature allows a user to hover over any section of any chat within the dashboard and be presented with highly accurate data of which that section represents. For example on the gender comparison bar chart; from first glance you can see there are more Female employees than Male, however if you hover over each section you can see the specific numbers 174 and 127. This allows users to see accurate numerical results which is way more powerful compared to ‘which bar is the highest’. When the hover statistics are based on a percentage of a whole, this is explained within the same div as its chart, meaning no user will be confused or get misled by any data provided.

3. **External Linking To Source File**

* This feature caters more towards professional users of the dashboard looking to research the topic in more detail. Within the introduction div of the project a sentence standing by itself states ‘To further study this topic please visit Here’, the link opens a new tab on the users device and opens the ‘Kaggle’ page for the dataset used for the project. This page has a multitude of new topics of data for Dental Magic to be researched and a community of users willing to share ideas. This is great for users who want to dive deeper into the topic, and will create a positive impact back on to the project dashboard.

4. **Flexbox Positioning**

* Throughout the dashboard I have used Flexbox for the positioning and responsiveness for all divs on the page. This has allowed me to create a dashboard suitable for any device without compromising the layout style or quality of the page. There are always constant margins separating each div equally on all side which is a result of flexbox, giving users a clean minimalistic style to appreciate and take advantage of. A user could view the page on a laptop, followed by an IPod and then even a small mobile device and the dashboard will work perfectly on all, this is an amazing feature which was easy to implement thanks to flexbox for the most part. This is extremely powerful as d3 itself does not support small devices however using flexbox this is not an issue.
 

## Left to implement

1. **Time Period Based Charts**

* When looking at future plan for the dashboard, I am planning to include a lot more charts which display data relating to specific time periods. This can be visualised for a user using charts such as line graphs and composite charts. This will add a unique perspective for a user and will definitely be a positive addition for all target groups to use. 
 

## Technologies used

1. **HTML** - https://www.w3.org/
* HTML was used to create the foundation of the website. All content on the website was created with hypertext markup language. This includes for example headings, links, descriptions, dropdown boxes, divs and more. 
2. **CSS** - https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html
* Although the CSS within this project was actually compiled and processed using Sass (described below), the CSS provides all styling throughout the project. Without this the page will be very standard and not worthy of deployment. This styling is linked through an external style sheet and is linked through the head section of the index file. 
3. **SASS** - https://sass-lang.com/
* Sass was used to great styling for the page which was then compiled into CSS. Many features of Sass make it a more very effective and efficient way of styling compared to normal CSS. I used several partials to separate styling groups, along with variables and mixins to create rules to call at any time.
4. **Google Fonts** - https://fonts.google.com/
* Google fonts were used to receive professional style fonts for the page. They provide a huge catalogue of fonts suitable for any style and theme. The clear example on my project would be to change in font from each divs title to brief description. The main fonts used on the project would be 'ZCOOL XiaoWei’ and 'Russo One'.
5. **JavaScript**
6. **Dc.js**
7. **D3.js**
8. **Crossfilter.js**
9. **Queue.js**
