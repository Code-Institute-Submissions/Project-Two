# Milestone Project Two – Interactive Frontend Development Project.
I have created a fully functional and interactive data dashboard based around the fictitious company ‘Dental Magic’ and its employee’s. The dashboard is extremely simple to use, providing users several drop-down boxes to filter the provided data to cater to specific needs. The minimalistic aesthetic design allows anyone to view clean, understandable results to enhance overall usability and experience. 

The dataset used for the project is based around the results from a human resource survey upon the company ‘Dental Magic’. All data is intentionally displayed with a specific heading and a brief description regarding what the chart is showing, which means any user experience is simply effortless. With full use of media queries the results can be fully displayed on any device; large or small. I believe this project has resulted in an efficient, clean-looking dataset suitable for any user to experience and enjoy.

## UX

In order to create the most efficient project as possible, one of the first steps was to understand who exactly was going to be using the data dashboard (and why). I came up with 3 main target groups:

#### Past and present employees of the company. 

* This target group will want to view the dashboard as an interest in their work-place to gain an overall image of the company and its staff, which could not be as easily achievable in the real world. This target group may also be interested in using the dashboard to see which departments are flourishing in terms of staff numbers, hourly wage and more so, an efficient employee could even use the data given to help boost their career within the business. Drop-down boxes allow users to narrow down results and generate highly specific results, so employees can see exactly what they are looking for.

#### Job seekers or agencies with an interest in the company. 

* This target group would be able to take advantage of the data provided within the dashboard to enable a broader view of the company. For example; they could view staff counts within specific departments, or with a simple glance at the current employment status of employee’s, they can clearly see which departments may need an increase of new employee’s in the near future. This is a brilliant tool for both work agencies and job seekers; as it can save a lot of time, especially when considering management of Dental Magic would need contacting to discuss statistics of this sort. Job seekers could also use the dashboard to see trends in hourly wages, meaning they could very easily see exactly what career path to go down to enhance earning power. This hourly rate data also comes hand in hand with information about each employee’s age, allowing a user to see how experience can affect their wages.

#### Data analyst’s collecting regional or national company data.

* This particular group will find the data dashboard extremely helpful and efficient due to the nature of their work. Let’s say as an example; an organization needed to collect gender statistics for all companies within a specific area. This dashboard provides a perfect solution to a very difficult task. All a user would have to do is simply find the Male to Female comparison bar chart, hover over each gender bar (instructions indicated in intro div to make sure the charts are as straightforward as possible), and they are then provided with correct numbers for both genders. Another method they could use would be to simply select the gender drop-down box (again labeled for easy use), and they are again presented with all options and the specific number on each option. These same methods apply across the board with the project, meaning no matter what task or data anyone would be trying to collect, it is extremely easy and efficient to collect.

### User stories

#### As a general user, I want to be able to clearly understand what is shown to me at first glance so I don’t have to do any further research.

* This was a vital aspect of the project; a main priority of mine was to make sure that any user (regardless of IT experience) could get access to the dashboard and immediately understand what is being shown to them visually in the form of interactive charts. The primary method I used to make sure of this was to create a simple to understand definition of each chart used as the title in each specific div. This means at first glance a user is presented with a large, bold title which will naturally be eye-catching and the first thing a user will read. This is then followed by a short sentence stating exactly what is being shown and how to make the most of the chart if required (usually by instructions based on tooltip statistics). These two methods combined result in a very short but effective description of every chart on the page and are an essential ‘go to’ for understanding fully what is being shown to them.  

#### As a professional user, I want to be able to gain extra information so I can carry out further research if needed.

* Due to the nature of the specified target groups, it is necessary for me to cater for both laid back users (typically past and present employees), and professional users (data analyst’s and agency workers). This means, although the project provides enough results to complete research on multiple data segments, it is also wise for me to offer a link to the source file used. This means professional users get the opportunity to view a huge file and gain access to more background information to the data set, along with a variety of data segments to work with. For this reason, I have provided a simple introductory div within the project always placed first so it is naturally the first thing a user will read. A user gets introduced with a brief overview, a link to the main source file and a list of drop-down boxes to enable filtered results. I believe the project does a good job catering for this specific target, making the overall user experience much more positive for everyone.

#### As a user, I want to be able to filter the data given to generate results which are advantageous to me.

* This user story goal is in very strong interest for all listed target groups. For this reason, it is the most prominent feature in terms of functionality within the dashboard. Many users may find the broad data provided enough for their particular task. However, many professional users or more engrossed casual users will want to see narrowed down, specific results. For example, a current employee might want to see a correlation between which departments are lacking in staff numbers but are flourishing in terms of hourly rates of pay. This could be used to gain a significant advantage in terms of career progression, especially within ‘Dental Magic’. All this user would need to do is find the introductory div placed at the beginning of the dashboard, use the multiple drop-down boxes provided efficiently; and they have highly filtered results that could be used at the user’s disposal. 

* A professional user of this dashboard may have been given a goal to check statistics in terms of each different department within the organization; this could be age, gender, ethnicity and employment status. This could be a highly tedious task which would involve a high number of questionnaires and surveys. However, using the dashboard the user simply would toggle the provided drop-down boxes and they are then presented immediately with correct, filtered data specific to any goal. A huge range of different results could be achieved within the dashboard, with all charts displaying highly accurate results in simple to understand, minimalistic charts.

* Mock-up designs and drawings for this project are uploaded within directories on Github. You can clearly see the development throughout each stage and can grasp the progress from start to the end product provided. 

## Features

I believe all the features I have chosen to carry out within the project are considered carefully and are closely aligned with efficiency and usability. It is undeniably better to have a handful of genuinely useless features compared to 100 unnecessary ones, so it was highly important for me to get that ratio correct. If all features were not completely effective on my data dashboard (or any project), I would have to consider that a failure, as a user would simply not be able to use it to full capacity, or may not use it at all.

## Existing features

1. **Dropdown Boxes**

* Placed within the very top of the dashboard within the introduction div, the users are presented with multiple drop-down boxes. These boxes could be used to alter the charts to display personalized data specific to the user. The use of these drop-down boxes are defined within the text above and they are all labeled with specific titles to show the user what exactly they can alter. The three boxes can successfully alter the data by filtering by gender, employee department and race. This results in a very powerful feature that almost all users will take advantage of, regardless of their intentions. This creates a positive user experience which is always great.
 
2. **Tooltip Hover Statistics**

* The information about this feature is again provided within the introduction div of the dashboard, a place every user will be again to scan quickly and see what is available for them to take advantage of. This feature allows a user to hover over any section of any chat within the dashboard and be presented with exact data of which that section represents. For example on the gender comparison bar chart; from first glance, you can see there are more Female employees than Male, however, if you hover over each section you can see the specific numbers 174 and 127. This allows users to see exact numerical results that are way more powerful compared to ‘which bar is the highest’. When the hover statistics are based on a percentage of a whole, this is always explained within the same div as its chart, meaning no user can get confused or get misled by any data provided.

3. **External Linking To Source File**

* This feature caters more towards professional users of the dashboard looking to research the topic in more detail. Within the introduction div of the project a sentence standing by itself states ‘To further study this topic please visit Here’, the link opens a new tab on the user's device and opens the ‘Kaggle’ page for the dataset used for the project. This page has a multitude of new topics of data for Dental Magic which could be researched and there is also a forum of users willing to share ideas. This is great for users who want to dive deeper into the topic, and will create a positive impact back on to the project dashboard.

4. **Flexbox Positioning**

* Throughout the dashboard, I have used Flexbox for the positioning and responsiveness for all divs on the page. This has allowed me to create a dashboard suitable for any device without compromising the layout style or quality of the page. There are always constant margins separating each div equally on all sides which are a result of flexbox, giving users a clean minimalistic style to appreciate and take advantage of. A user could view the page on a laptop, followed by an iPod and then even a small mobile device and the dashboard will work perfectly on all, this is an amazing feature that was easy to carry out thanks to flexbox for the most part. This is extremely powerful as d3 itself does not support small devices however using flexbox this is not an issue.
 

## Left to implement

1. **Time Period Based Charts**

* When looking at the plans for the dashboard, I am planning to include a lot more charts that display data on specific time periods. This could be visualized for a user using charts such as line graphs and composite charts. This will add a unique perspective for a user and will definitely be a positive addition for all target groups to use. 
 

## Technologies used

1. **HTML** - https://www.w3.org/
* HTML is used to create the foundations of the website. All content on the website is created with hypertext markup language. This includes headings, links, descriptions, drop-down boxes, divs and more.
2. **CSS** - https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html
* Although the CSS within this project was actually compiled and processed using Sass (described below), the CSS provides all styling throughout the project. Without this, the page will be very standard and not worthy of deployment. This styling was linked through an external style sheet and was linked through the head section of the index file.
3. **SASS** - https://sass-lang.com/
* Sass is used to great styling for the page which was then compiled into CSS. Many features of Sass make it a more very effective and efficient way of styling compared to normal CSS. I used several partials to separate styling groups, along with variables and mixins to create rules to call at any time.
4. **Google Fonts** - https://fonts.google.com/
* Google fonts are used to receive professional style fonts for the page. They offer a huge catalog of fonts suitable for any style and theme. The clear example on my project would be the change in the font from each divs title to the brief description. The main fonts used on the project would be 'ZCOOL XiaoWei’ and 'Russo One’.
5. **JavaScript** - https://www.javascript.com/
* JavaScript could be perceived as the most vital language used within my project. JavaScript is used with other JavaScript libraries to create and render all of the charts seen on the page along with all the details they offer. Without JavaScript the page would only consist of a base provided by HTML and CSS, JavaScript provides the rest! If the JavaScript was wrong, the dashboard would be doomed until resolved.
6. **Dc.js** - https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/
* Dc.js is a JavaScript library and is used to create the data-driven charts used on the page. It works used with the data set I provided it. It creates an efficient solution to programmers who want to create fast and functional charts in a reliable way.
7. **D3.js** - https://d3js.org/
* D3.js is another JavaScript library and was used in conjunction with Dc.js (shown above) to help render the charts. IT renders the charts visually using a combination of HTML, SVG, and CSS. Again d3.js is a brilliant go-to for programmers who want to create solid charts quickly and effectively.
8. **Crossfilter.js** - https://square.github.io/crossfilter/
* Again Crossfilter.js is a JavaScript library and was used to explore large datasets in very rapid time. Crossfilter supports fast interaction with coordinated views and works with D3.js and Dc.js for this project.

## Deployment

The deployment process of this project was fairly straightforward but the method is very methodical. At the beginning of the project workspace creation, the very first task I needed to complete is to generate a git repository using the ‘git init’ command. From there I know I have a safe place to store all of my work which I can later retrieve from anywhere. All of this was achievable through my Cloud9 workspace.

After I have created my repository and I have reached a point where I would like to save some more of my work (usually after small successes on the project), I would follow the method of reviewing the git status (using command ‘git status’) to see any untracked files that need adding, from that point I can then choose which files to save now or wait until a later date. The process of adding files to what is called a staging area is fairly simple, all I needed to do was use the command ‘git add ____’ (blank being the specific files I would like to add), and press enter. Once I am happy with the files I would like to save to the git repository, I would then send the command ‘git commit –m’ with a specific message which I (and other programmers) can then use at a later date to distinguish the changes I have made, and again press enter.

The files are then stored safely and are ready to be ‘pushed’ when I believe they are at a good enough level to be deployed. First however I needed to create a remote repository on Github, this means my workspace can be stored online ready to be deployed and for other contributors to see and edit. I do this by simply following the simple instructions provided by Github, once completed I pushed my work using ‘git push’ followed by my personal Github login details.

Finally at this point, I hosted my work online using ‘Github pages’, I then received a domain link which the project is then hosted to. This is then my deployed version of my project. I can still edit my development code which is still saved to my own private workspace. I use this to edit, upgrade, and test all areas of the project safely while the deployed version stays the same. Once I am happy with an upgrade and I want to apply these to the deployed version, all I need to do is follow the same process as before. Once the new code was pushed on to the remote repository the deployed version is then upgraded for the public to use.

## Testing

Testing is always an absolutely essential aspect of any project as without thorough testing, you look yourself and your project wide open for mistakes, user complaints and a lack of appreciation for your hard work.

Naturally during the testing processes of my project, I met several little bugs along the way which needed to be resolved before carrying on. I believe a developer can never be too careful when testing for errors as a deployed website full of errors can be disastrous. Due to this reason I ensured I spent enough time finding and fixing errors before any of my code was even considered for deployment.

I needed to make sure the goals stated by my written user stories were easily achievable for any user (regardless of IT knowledge or experience). If a user struggles for even a moment or cannot simply do what they want to do; they will leave the site and never come back, so this is a vital aspect of the project.

I have listed the user stories below and will explain how I have catered for each need.

#### As a general user, I want to be able to clearly understand what is shown to me at first glance so I don’t have to do any further research.
* This user story was absolutely vital because a user NEEDS to know what is going on within a split second, a humans attention span is not great (especially if they are only browsing) so I needed to make sure a user can visit the project and immediately know what was being shown to them.
* As a result of this, I created a large page title of ‘Dental Magic basic Employee History’ which quickly summarises the content within the page, this title is also placed as usual at the very top of the page and is displayed in a large thick black font which naturally ensures it is the first thing a user will read; this will give a good overview before they dive deeper.
* The next step I took to make sure a user knows exactly what they are looking at immediately is another large heading is sat at the top of each div containing a chart, the title is a very brief sentence which nicely explains what the chart represents, such as I have used ‘Employee gender Comparison’ and ‘Employee Current Employment Status’ which are very self-explanatory. If a user spots a chart that he/she may be interested in, I have also placed another explanation underneath the title which states how best to use the chart and how exactly the data could be interpreted.  

#### As a professional user, I want to be able to gain extra information so I can carry out further research if needed.
* This user story as mentioned above caters more towards the professional user or anyone who wants to investigate this data in above average detail. This is always important as I understand that this target group factors in a large percentage of users.
* What I did to cater to this need was simple but in my opinion efficient and effective. The very first div within the project (always placed first in order) is there to offer a user with a brief description of the project and give instructions for the user, so this is naturally the first thing a user will read. I have included a sentence which stands alone and states ‘To further study this topic please visit here’, with the ‘here’ underlined and the font color changed to alert the user that this is a clickable link. This is easily spotted on the dashboard and professional users will almost certainly see straight away. Once clicked the user will have accessed the ‘kaggle’ page which provides a user with the source file and more detailed information about the dataset; this will be opened within a new tab to ensure users will stay on the dashboard and use it further. 

#### As a user, I want to be able to filter the data given to generate results which are advantageous to me.
* This user story is arguably the most important but is definitely the most powerful aspect of the dashboard and was vital to get functioning perfectly. This user goal was suitable for all users and allows users to personally filter the data shown throughout the dashboard to cater to their personal needs immediately and easily.
* As this feature was so important for all groups, it is again placed within the intro div placed at the top of the screen. At the bottom of this div it is visible right away that the user is then presented with three drop-down boxes all labeled above, these are the boxes that allow the results to be filtered. Right above these boxes, a sentence states to the user ‘Please use selectors below to toggle results’, again this sentence stands alone to make sure it is not missed by the user and is very easily viewable. 
* As all boxes were labeled especially for each one's specific use, it is very easy to understand at first glance but more importantly, it is very easy to use for all users.

##### Dropdown Boxes.
1. Go to the intro div which presents all dropdown boxes.
2. Select a gender of your choice and see the charts change.
3. Keep gender option selected and repeat the process for the other two boxes.
4. Mix and match all you like and see how the charts mould to your needs quickly.
5. Either refresh the page or reset choices by choosing ‘select all’ on either box.

Another huge goal I had to make sure the project was a success was to make it responsive as possible and make the user experience on all devices a positive one. This naturally took a bit of trial and error in terms of chart sizing, padding, and margins.  However, I believe I have it to a point where any screen size can effectively take advantage of all the features and benefits the dashboard can give. The way this was possible for me was by using flexbox, it offers a very simple but effective way to place elements within a document and have them respond to any change in screen size, using elements such as display flex, order, and flex wrap.

This was used along with my sass media queries in which I have edited the dashboard at varying breakpoints where I feel it necessary to change things such as width and overflow-x. This is very important as by default dc.js does not cater for screen sizes below desktop so this caused a few issues at first, I easily resolved this issue by simply allowing a user to scroll to the right inside each div if needed on a smaller device which then allows them to view each div in its entirety instead of cutting sections out. This means no matter what device no user will be missing out, and the overall style of the page is not lost. Try viewing the dashboard on several different viewpoint sizes and see how the project adjusts accordingly.

I met a couple of bugs along the way which needed addressing before the project was acceptable to be deployed; an example of this is as mentioned above as dc.js does not by default support screen sizes below the average desktop. This means a huge majority of the target users would be lost as they may be using smartphones or Ipads for example. The fix for this problem was fairly easy as using media queries I was able to create specific breakpoints where the dashboard will automatically change when they are hit. In this specific example once the screen size drops below 425px a feature will appear which will let users scroll left and right within each div containing a chart. This means they can still view all the data provided within the chart even though the screen size drops massively. This is a nice feature which increases user experience by a considerable amount.
